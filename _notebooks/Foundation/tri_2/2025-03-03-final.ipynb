    "I‚Äôve used creative development in my projects by designing and coding solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether it‚Äôs building a frontend that seamlessly integrates with a backend API or improving user experience with an emoji dropdown, I‚Äôve had to think creatively. I‚Äôve also refined my code iteratively, testing and improving it based on feedback and functionality requirements.\n",

    "My feature is part of a **web page** that enables users to add, view, and reset their reactions to books through an interactive UI. This program fosters creative expression by allowing users to select emoji-based reactions, making their responses **visually engaging** and **emotionally expressive**. Throughout development, I iteratively refined the UI to ensure accessibility and ease of use. "

    "In my work, I apply algorithms and programming principles to ensure my code is efficient and scalable. I use loops, conditionals, and functions to make my code reusable, especially when implementing features like update and delete functionality. Debugging and optimizing algorithms help improve performance, ensuring the frontend interacts smoothly with the backend API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program uses a **series of functions and event-driven programming** to handle user interactions, API calls, and UI updates. Key algorithms include:\n",
    "- **Fetching book data**: Calls the backend API to retrieve books and dynamically populates a dropdown menu.\n",
    "- **Displaying user reactions**: Fetches user reactions from the backend and updates the UI.\n",
    "- **Resetting reactions**: Sends a DELETE request to reset a user‚Äôs reactions and removes them from the UI."

    "Understanding computer systems and networks has been crucial when working with APIs and ensuring secure data transmission between the frontend and backend. I consider factors like HTTP requests, data formats (JSON), and handling network errors. Security is also important, so I keep in mind best practices for protecting user data when integrating with external systems.\n",

    "- **DELETE requests** to reset reactions.\n",
    "\n",

Proper error handling ensures reliability, improving the overall **network-based communication** in my application."
