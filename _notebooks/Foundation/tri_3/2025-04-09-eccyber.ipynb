    "# key learnings, personal takeaways, what u got out of this \n",
    "- **Cybersecurity is everywhere** — from major corporations to small businesses, everyone needs it. The threat landscape is evolving rapidly with ransomware, phishing, AI-based attacks, and 0-day vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- **People are still the weakest link** — even experienced professionals fall for phishing. This shows the importance of continual education and awareness.\n",
    "- **Ethical hackers are essential** — like hiring a burglar to test your home security, organizations need ethical hackers to find and fix weaknesses before real attackers do.\n",
    "- **Soft skills matter just as much as technical ones** — being likable, curious, and collaborative can open doors and help build trust when advocating for security investments.\n",
    "- **You don’t need a traditional background** — many professionals came into cybersecurity from unrelated fields or without formal degrees. What matters most is passion, adaptability, and a willingness to learn.\n",
    "- **Certifications help** — foundational certs like A+, Network+, and Certified Cybersecurity (ISC2) are great entry points.\n",
    "- **Build your own digital footprint** — create, break, and rebuild your own systems to learn hands-on. Internships, real-world projects, and networking will take you far.\n",
    "- **The future is specialized** — expect more focused roles in areas like healthcare IT, secure software, and threat intelligence.\n",
    "- **Always stay in the loop** — cybersecurity pros read constantly, learn from their network, and adapt to new threats like a tight-knit sports team.\n",
    "- **You’ll face obstacles** — whether it’s lack of resources, skeptical execs, or team conflicts, being able to communicate clearly and push forward is key.\n",
    "- It is important to put yourself out there and to contantly improve your skills. This includes technical and soft skills. \n",
