    "📘 What is Binary Search?\n",
    "Binary Search is a powerful algorithm used to quickly find an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n",
    "Binary search is much faster than linear search for large datasets. It’s often referred to as a “divide and conquer” algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Check the middle element\n",
    "2. If it’s the target, return it\n",
    "3. If not, search the left or right half\n",
    "4. Repeat until found or empty\n",
    "\n",
    "⏱️ Time Complexity of Binary Search\n",
    "- Binary search is efficient because it divides the search space in half with every step. Here’s how its time complexity breaks down:\n",
    "- 🧠 At each step, we eliminate half of the remaining elements.\n",
    "- 🧮 This “halving” continues until there’s only one element left.\n",
    "- ✨ This gives us a logarithmic number of steps — specifically:\n",
    "`Time Complexity: O(log₂ n)` Where n is the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why O(log n)?\n",
    "- If we start with n items:\n",
    "- After 1 comparison → n/2 items left\n",
    "- After 2 comparisons → n/4 items left\n",
    "- After 3 comparisons → n/8 items left\n",
    "…\n",
    "After k comparisons → 1 item left\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "`n / (2^k) = 1 → 2^k = n → k = log₂(n)`\n",
    "✅ So in the worst case, binary search takes about log₂(n) steps to find the target (or determine it’s not there).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it much faster than linear search (O(n)), especially on large datasets!\n",
    "\n",

    "### Free Response\n",
    "Why is binary search more efficient for large data than linear search?\n",
    "- Binary search eliminates half the search space with each comparison, making it **O(log n)** instead of **O(n)** like linear search. This is much faster for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if the list isn’t sorted and you try to use binary search?\n",
    "- If the list isn’t sorted, binary search won’t work correctly—it might miss the target or give the wrong result entirely since it relies on the order to eliminate half the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you use binary search in a video game leaderboard or streaming service search bar? Why or why not?\n",
    "- Yes, if the data is sorted (e.g. leaderboard by score or search suggestions alphabetically), binary search can speed up lookups. But in real-time or fuzzy searches, other algorithms might be more appropriate."

    "A few real world applications for random number generations include video games and gambling. In video games, random numbers are used to generate unpredictable outcomes like loot drops, enemy behavior, or terrain generation. This adds variety and replayability, making games more engaging and dynamic. In gambling, random number generation ensures fairness and unpredictability in games like slots, roulette, or lottery draws. It prevents patterns or bias, which is crucial for maintaining trust and legal compliance.\n"

    "# Binary Search is significantly faster because it cuts the list in half with each comparison (O(log n)). Linear Search checks each element one by one (O(n)), making it much slower on large lists. If you run both searches on an unsorted list, Binary Search will not work correctly on an unsorted list—it depends on order to eliminate half the options. Linear Search still works fine because it simply checks every element regardless of order."

Greedy algorithms work well in situations where making a smaller optimal choice at each step leads to a altogether more optimal solution. This works well in things like coin demoninations. But they don't work where local choices don't lead to the best overall result. \n",

    "What is one thing you changed, and what did it show you? One thing I changed was the order of the coin denominations from largest to smallest to smallest to largest.
