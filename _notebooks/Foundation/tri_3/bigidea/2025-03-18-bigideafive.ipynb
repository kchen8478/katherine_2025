    "- One harmful effect of technology is cyberbullying on social media. Many children and teenagers are exposed to harmful messages, harassment, and inappropriate content, which can severely impact their mental health. Victims of cyberbullying often experience anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, and in extreme cases, it has led to self-harm or suicide. Additionally, viral challenges and trends can be dangerous, encouraging reckless behavior that puts young people at risk. While social media can connect people, its misuse can lead to devastating consequences, making it a significant harmful effect of modern technology.\n",

    "Write 5 sentences describing what you have noticed about the digital divide in your own community. Consider how socioeconomic factors, location, and access to technology may play a role. Then explain how you can personally help bridge this gap—perhaps through awareness, advocating for policy changes, or supporting community-based tech programs. Make sure each sentence provides a clear insight or action step. Submit your 5 sentences in the next class.\n",
    "- In my community, I’ve noticed that students from lower-income households often struggle with completing online assignments due to unreliable internet access or a lack of personal devices. Rural areas face connectivity challenges, making remote learning and telemedicine difficult for many families who rely on these services. Public libraries and community centers provide internet access, but they often have limited hours, making it hard for students and job seekers to use them effectively. I can help bridge this gap by advocating for local government initiatives that provide subsidized internet access and devices to underprivileged students. Additionally, I can volunteer with local organizations that teach digital literacy skills, ensuring that more people in my community can benefit from available technology."
