The program retrieves data from a backend API and displays it in an interactive UI. Users can:\n",

    "## Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks\n",
    "Understanding computer systems and networks has been crucial when working with APIs and ensuring secure data transmission between the frontend and backend. I consider factors like HTTP requests, data formats (JSON), and handling network errors. Security is also important, so I keep in mind best practices for protecting user data when integrating with external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program depends on **HTTP requests** to communicate between the frontend and backend. It uses:\n",
    "- **GET requests** to retrieve book and reaction data.\n",
    "- **POST requests** to add user reactions.\n",
    "- **DELETE requests** to reset reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires understanding **client-server interactions**, where the frontend sends structured requests and processes JSON responses asynchronously using JavaScript’s `fetch()` API. Proper error handling ensures reliability, improving the overall **network-based communication** in my application."

When users delete a reaction, a **for loop iterates through the existing reactions in the database**.
