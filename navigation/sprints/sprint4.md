## Girl in CS Panel
This panel featured four college students who talked about their experience in CS so far and also their college applications. After hearing their answers, I notice how many of them went over how they used things like agile and scrum within their extracurriculars, and how it helps with management and with organization, which I believe are two important soft skills to have. I never realized, but several, especially David, talked about exploring further within their own major, but also in other majors or topics. Having knowledge in several fields, especially if you're interested isn't a bad thing, and hearing the panelists talk about themselves still exploring their interests and passions, makes me realize this isn't just a high school, college thing, but exploring and learning is something you'll do for your entire career. I had always thought that people would major is something, and that would mean they won't really explore other topics, but it is a possible and common thing, which I plan on looking into, especially minoring in something, or doing a double major, although those we not brought up. Several panelists are stated that they wish they had taken more community college classes as a high school because it would have allowed them to learn more which also earning transferable credit. Dual enrollment is something I have though about, but more for taking a class that I need to take rather than one I want to taken, so I plan on looking into Palomar's classes. Overall, I learned quite a bit about college and how it is and isn't similar to high school, and these panelists were able to share a lot of their experience and knowledge to us.
