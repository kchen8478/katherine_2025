## I went into this team teach with a pretty solid foundation of python, so many lessons were good review. 
# BLOG
- My blog has all the homework and hacks from each lesson, plus a small summary of what I learned. I'll be able to review from these for Project Based Learning Projects. 

# MEMORY
- Our lesson when into detail about the 9 data types, and we had a mini quiz that tested each one. 

# RELEVANCY
- 3.2: Data types are present in everything, especially integars, strings, and lists. We also taught dictionaries, tuples, sets, booleans, and None. 
- 3.1: variable and string operations (e.g. PEMDAS operations for numbers and strong concatenation)
- 3.3: mathematical operations (+-*/)
- 3.4: string operations (slicing, string length, replacements, or joining)
- 3.5: booleans - can be used for rational or logical operations 
- 3.6: if else loops help control the flow of a program + execute specific code under specific conditions
- 3.7: nested loops - good when having multiple condiitons
- 3.8: for loops, while loops, do/while loops, infinite loops, try/except
- 3.10: how to access elements and change elements in a list

# BEYOND PERFUNCTORY
- All my hacks have unique code from the solutions are I am able to explain each and every part of them. 

## Through this team teach, I learned a lot about what it means to be part of a team and to collaborate and communication. I also got to know the perspective of a teacher, when creating the lesson, teaching, and grading.
