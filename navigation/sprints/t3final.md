# N@TM:
Our group presented Genescope, the project we developed for the Open Coding Society and PilotCity. We began with an overview of our target audience and the purpose behind the platform, highlighting our mission to educate users about biotechnology through interactive learning. We walked the audience through key featuresâ€”including a functional voice chat, biotech news updates, and interactive games. Attendees were invited to explore the platform firsthand, and we gathered valuable feedback as they engaged with the different components of our site.
