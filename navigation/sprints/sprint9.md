## HP CTE Expo Blog 5/22
Yesterday, I attended the CTE Expo and I visited several stations including the Open Coding Society, Team Optix, PPMC, and several others. At the OCS station, I viewed their bathroom pass, created by CSA, and also Risha's Biotech game. I went at around 5:30 and stayed until 7.
