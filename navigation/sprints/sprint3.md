Capture memories as we go.
Big Idea 1.1 Collaboration
- Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration
  - Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity and talents of those who designed it.
  - Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias during development.
- Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
  - Think-Pair-Share.  Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with class..
  - Two programmers work as a pair on features and ideas.
  - Online tools to support collaboration (ie Slack), allowing developers to provide feedback and share ideas
- Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
  - Communication
  - Consensus Building
  - Conflict Resolution
  - Negotiation
Big Idea 1.2 Program Function and Purpose
- Describe the purpose of a computing innovation.  
  - Be sure you can describe the purpose of flocker
  - What category of innovation is this?  (social media). 
  - What other categories.
- How does understanding the innovation improve the ability to develop?  Here are some considerations.
  - Identify inputs and type (ie keyboard, touch, camera)
  - Events that are generated from inputs
  - Outputs generated from inputs or events
  - User interface design
  - User experience design
- Coding knowledge
  - Explain coding in terms of code segment and functions
  - The behavior of program and how it behaves during execution
    - Explain frontend coding - how code is organized and runs (inputs and events)
    - Explain backend coding - how it is distinct from frontend (algorithms and storage)
Big Idea 1.3  Program Design and Development
- Develop a program using a Development Process (aka Agile Scrum).  Use a process that is iterative and revision based.
  - Investigate and reflect
  - Design / Storyboard
  - Prototype / Isolate your experiments
  - Code / Organize into functions and objects
  - Test, Test, Test / Automate test cases
  - Repeat
- Design a program and its User Interface.
  - Describe how program will behave
  - Include list of user interactions

<p class="solid">A solid border.</p>
<p class="double">A double border.</p>
<p class="groove">A groove border.</p>
<p class="ridge">A ridge border.</p>
<p class="inset">An inset border.</p>
<p class="outset">An outset border.</p>
<p class="none">No border.</p>

    <p>Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines.</p>
